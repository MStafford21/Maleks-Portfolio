                    <p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500" data-aos-delay="1600">Growing up my love for technology guided me towards the path 
                        of becoming a software engineer/developer and advancement of technological software. 
                        The opportunity to participate in this research would be an 
                        amazing and informative experience to help me on my career path. As the world grows 
                        new technology emerges and changes how we view life,
                         AI being the most recent advancement has really peeked my 
                         interest due to its many applications. As well as incorporating data science we could 
                         study their transformative potential across various aspects
                          particularly in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and 
                          communication.However, My interest with both AI and data 
                          science comes from the idea that they could revolutionize 
                          patient care, optimize treatment plans, and facilitate 
                          collaboration among healthcare professionals. 
                          The potential of machine learning algorithms ability to 
                          advance topics like interpreting organ-agnostic CT scans 
                          really grabbed my attention. Using technology to advance 
                          biological solutions was always a topic of conversation 
                          between my aunt and myself, seeing that she works as a medical doctor. 
                          AI has a multitude of uses that can be leveraged to also 
                          address other issues that I would love to explore</p>
